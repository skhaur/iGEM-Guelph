            “The iGem student-led program provided an engaging and meaningful learning experience for our Grade 5 and 6 students. The leaders guided the group through hands-on experiments, thoughtful discussions, and interactive activities that connected directly to biodiversity and its importance for both human and animal health. Their ability to explain complex ideas in an age-appropriate way ensured that students not only participated actively but also deepened their understanding of real-world science. 
            
            The facilitators were enthusiastic, kind, and adaptable throughout the sessions, responding well to the needs and interests of the students. They created a welcoming atmosphere where curiosity was encouraged, and every student felt comfortable asking questions and sharing ideas. Their energy and passion for science were contagious, sparking excitement and engagement among the students. 
            
            Overall, the iGem program was a valuable experience that combined learning with fun. The leadership skills of the facilitators shone through in the way they balanced structure with flexibility, keeping students focused while allowing space for creativity. The students came away with not only a stronger grasp of biodiversity and health connections, but also a positive memory of exploring science in a hands-on and collaborative way. 
            
            Thank you!"<br>

          <h4>Life Science Curriculum Support</h4>
          <p>
            Our work represents an important step towards integrating synthetic biology into Ontario classrooms, broadening student access to innovative science while reducing preparation time for teachers through ready-to-use activities. More information on how to access the repertoire will be available by October 2026.

          <h4>Creative Encounters</h4>
          <p>
            “This summer, I was able to experience iGEM's mentors Sky sessions for our Grade 4-5 STEM summer camp called Earth, Ocean, and Air. In this camp, one of the days was focused on microbes and their important role in human biology. In their session, iGEM volunteers walked our campers through a short, engaging presentation about what microbes are and their importance for our health. After this presentation, the volunteers introduced an activity where the campers were able to create keychains that commemorated what they had learned. After observing all of the iGEM sessions that ran for Earth, Ocean, and Sky this summer, I can wholeheartedly say that iGEM was an incredible mentor for our audience. All of their volunteers came with a positive attitude and were excited to engage youth with STEM, and were amazing role models for our campers.”

          <h4>Biosecurity Escape Room & Biosecurity events</h4>
          <p>
            To welcome new students, iGEM Guelph hosted a Biosecurity Escape Room in which participants roleplayed as scientists locked in a lab by hackers after sensitive information was leaked. The Escape Room involved a series of puzzles with cues and items scattered in the room that would help participants identify the leaked pathogen's genetic modifications and figure out which organization infiltrated the lab. Multiple rooms were run at once with each team being timed to provide a competitive and immersive edge to the game.
          </p>
          <br>
          <h4>Treasure Boxes</h4>
          <p>
            iGEM Guelph created Treasure Boxes, curated lesson kits filled with hands-on science activities designed for students in grades 1-4. Each activity was carefully chosen to be curriculum-appropriate with the Ontario Ministry of Education standards, engaging, and easy to follow, allowing young learners to explore science in a fun and accessible way. The boxes were delivered to classrooms, giving teachers ready-to-use resources that brought scientific concepts to life for their students. Its contents are easily re-creatable with accessible materials that we would encourage other organizations, iGEM teams, or educators to adopt, visit the Contributions webpage to access the materials. Lastly, the College of Biological Sciences Office of Educational Scholarships and Practice provided us with a generous grant to carry this project out.
